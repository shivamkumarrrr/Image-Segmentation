# Vision Project: Image Segmentation

Welcome to the Vision Project on Image Segmentation repository!

This repository is dedicated to the capstone project for the "Neural Networks: Theory and Implementation" (NNTI) course at Saarland University. The project serves as a primer on the task of object segmentation, requiring the application of various neural network methodologies. Students are tasked with implementing different neural network approaches to tackle object segmentation, drawing upon the knowledge acquired during the course. The project is structured into three distinct tasks, each with its own set of challenges and learning outcomes.

The project leverages the PyTorch library for all implementations.

## Overview of Tasks

For a more detailed explanation of each task, please refer to the wiki page and the project report.

### **Task 1:**
Task 1 serves as the foundational step into object segmentation. Participants are provided with a partially completed notebook and are tasked with finalizing the segmentation process on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset using an architecture of their choice. To engage with the implementation, please run the `Vision_task_1.ipynb` notebook.

### **Task 2:**
This task involves replicating the architecture described in the provided [reference paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1802/1802.06955.pdf) and applying it to the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/). To replicate our findings, ensure that the dataset is located in the `'/datasets'` directory and execute the `Task 2.ipynb` notebook.

### **Task 3:**
The third task is a challenge that encourages participants to enhance the results obtained from Task 2. We have introduced a novel architecture that integrates 'Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling' and 'Attention Gates' with the previously used R2U-Net, which we have named ASPP R2U-Net with Attention Gates. To replicate our results, run the `Task 3.ipynb` notebook.
